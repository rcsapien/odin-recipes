        <li>1 1/2 cups of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the diced onions and minced garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet with the cooked beef. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, and beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers with half of the remaining meat sauce, 3 lasagna noodles, the remaining ricotta cheese mixture, and another third of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Finish with the final layer of the remaining meat sauce, the remaining 3 lasagna noodles, and the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. This will make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
    </ol>
